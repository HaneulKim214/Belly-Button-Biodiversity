Building full-stack website using Python(Flask), javascript(d3, plotly), html5, css3, and bootstrap4.

Interactive dashboard is build from this data set: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

Data is simply information on microbes inhabiting in our belly buttons from multiple samples.
