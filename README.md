**Goal:** 

Using data on sample's microbes living in their belly button, create interative visualization that interpret information about each sample.

part I:
- Query data from SQL to create interative selection bars and create interative visualization for each sample.
- Starting from python, work on html, js, and css to develop fully functioning web, both front and back end.

part II:
- Use heroku's PostgreSQL and load data there for it can be queried. Data source:http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/
- Deploy the app
